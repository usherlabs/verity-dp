# Simplified Explanation of How to Read the Benchmark Results

This script runs a program multiple times, measures how long each run takes, and calculates the average runtime. Here's how you can read the benchmark results:

---

### **Variables to change**
- `BONSAI_API_KEY`: Bonsai credentials
- `BONSAI_API_URL`: Bonsai Credentials
- `use_precompute`: Determines if the program should run with the `precompute` optimization.
- `iteration_count`: The number of times the program will be run to calculate the average.

---

### **Benchmark Execution**
```
bash bonsairun.sh
```
---

### **Average Calculation**

- The program is run multiple times (as specified by `iteration_count`).
- The script collects the runtimes for each iteration.
- It calculates the average of these runtimes.

---

### **Result Output**

The final output shows the average time it took for the program to run across all iterations.

---

### **Example of the Output**

If each program run takes 10, 12, and 8 seconds respectively:
```bash
The average time taken to run is 10 seconds
```
